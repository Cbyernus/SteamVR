# What is the Input Profile

SteamVR uses driver-provided Input Profile JSON files to control how application actions are bound to the input state provided by the driver. There is one input profile file for each type of device supported by the driver. The expected location of the input profile JSON file is "_driver dir_/resources/input/<device_type>_profile.json". The vive_controller_profile.json file in _steamvr install dir_/drivers/resources/input is a good example to use when creating your input profile file.

The driver identifies which file to load via the Prop_InputProfilePath_String property on each device. This string usually takes the form {drivername}/input/filename_profile.json, which will automatically expand {drivername} to the install path of that driver. You can have as many of these files as you need for your driver, up to one per input device type your driver exposes.

Generally drivers should provide input profiles for each controller and HMD exposed by that driver. To support older drivers, SteamVR will generate an approximate profile for devices that don't have a profile provided, but a driver can do a better job than SteamVR itself.

# Input Profile Format

```json
{
  "jsonid" : "input_profile",
  "controller_type": "<controller type>",
  "legacy_binding" :  "<legacy binding file>",
  "input_bindingui_mode" : "<UI mode>",
  "input_bindingui_left" :
  {
    "transform" : "scale(-1,1)",
    "image": "<image path>"
  },
  "input_bindingui_right" :
  {
    "image": "<image path>"
  },
  "input_source" :
  {
    "<input source path>" : { 
        "type" : "<input source type>",
        "binding_image_point" : [ 10, 59 ],
        "order" : 2
    },
    ...
    "/pose/raw" : 
    {
        "type" : "pose",
        "binding_image_point" : [ 14, 16 ]
    },
    ...
  },
  "default_bindings" : 
  [
    {
      "app_key" : "steam.app.1234",
      "binding_url" : "steam.app.1234_<controller_type>.json"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**controller type** is the key that's used to store bindings per-app for this controller. Including your driver name or brand name in the controller type is a good idea so it doesn't collide with controller types from other drivers. Some examples of controller types are:

* vive
* vive_pro
* vive_controller
* gamepad

Controller types should be ASCII and short. This is not the human-readable name, it is the internal name that will be stored in data and log files.

**legacy binding file** is the path to the binding file to use for legacy apps whenever this controller is active. It is the same format as other input binding files, and can be built with the SteamVR binding UI and then exported. _(The binding UI isn't actually available yet as of this writing, but it's coming soon)._  These paths are usually driver relative and should take this form: {drivername}/input/mycontroller_legacy_bindings.json.

**UI mode** - This is one of:

* hmd - The device is a HMD and wants the binding UI to be in HMD mode when configuring it for input
* single_device - The device should be on a page by itself. Examples are xbox-style game controllers and gun style controllers.
* controller_handed - The device type is typically used as a pair, one in each hand. The device can optionally be specific to a left or right hand. When using the binding UI with this style of device 2 controllers will be displayed.

**image path** - This is the path to the driver-relative image file (ideally SVG or PNG ) that the binding UI should show for this device. This is generally of the form {drivername}/input/mycontroller.svg. The binding UI has no fixed size and will scale to the output device so using the SVG format ensures the best presentation of your controller. The image should do its best to expose the position of the inputs available on the device. Using a canted view of your device is typically recommended. 

**transform** - This string is passed to the CSS transform field in the binding UI. Its typically usage is to mirror your devices image using the string "scale( -1, 1)" so you can use a single image for both left and right hands.

**input source path** - There is one input source specified for each input on the device. Individual components are grouped into input sources to allow the user to manipulate them as a group. For example, the input source /input/trigger contains the input components /input/trigger/value and optionally /input/trigger/click, and /input/trigger/touch.

**input source type** - Each input source has a type. The available types are:
* joystick - The input is a joystick or thumbstick. Supports these components:
  * /input/_joystickname_/x
  * /input/_joystickname_/y
  * /input/_joystickname_/click - Optional. If there is no click component the joystick won't support binding to click.
  * /input/_joystickname_/touch - Optional. If there is no touch component the joystick won't support binding to touch.
* trackpad - The input is a trackpad. It supports these components:
  * /input/_trackpadname_/x
  * /input/_trackpadname_/y
  * /input/_trackpadname_/touch
  * /input/_trackpadname_/click - Optional.
* trigger - The input is a trigger (or an analog grip button.) It supports these components:
  * /input/_trigger name_/value
  * /input/_trigger name_/click - Optional
  * /input/_trigger name_/touch - Optional
* button - The input is a button. It supports these components:
  * /input/_trigger name_/click
  * /input/_trigger name_/touch - Optional
* skeleton - The input is a skeletal animation source
  * /input/_component name_/
* haptic - The input is a haptic component
  * /output/_component name_/
* pose - The input is a pose component. These are created automatically from the components in the device's rendermodel.
  * /pose/_component name_/


**binding_image_point** is the 2D position on the unscaled image that should be highlighted for this source when using the binding UI.

**order** is an optional setting that allows the input profile to control the order of the input sources displayed in the UI. Commonly used sources (such as a primary trigger) should be listed before less used sources.

# Input Profile Localization

Input source names and controller type strings can be translated into a user's native language with a driver-provided localization file. This file lives in "_driver install dir_/resources/localization/localization.json".

Its format is:

```json
[
  {
    "language_tag": "en_US",
    "my_controller_type" : "My Controller Type",
    "/input/button_name" : "Awesome Button"
  }
]
```

The language tag is the ISO-639-1 + ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 of the locale that part of the localization file is for. The localization file can contain any number of locales. The _my controller type_ field in this example should be the same name you used for the **controller type** field above.

# Pose components

Unlike scalar, boolean, and skeletal components, pose components are defined implicitly by the render model provided by the driver for the device in question. See <steamvr>/resources/rendermodels/vr_controller_vive_1_5/vr_controller_vive_1_5.json for an example:
```json
        "tip": {
            "component_local" : {
                "origin": [0.0, -0.01, -0.007],
                "rotate_xyz" : [1.282,0.0,0.0]
            }
        },
```
Every render model component that does not specify a "filename" field will be added as a component automatically when the tracked device is activated. To expose the pose in the binding UI, add a "pose" input source with the name /pose/<component name> (so /pose/tip in the above example.) You can control what render model is used by your device by setting the Prop_RenderModelName_String property on the device.

All tracked devices also get two pose components registered regardless of what render model they use: /pose/raw and /pose/tip. By default, both are set to the unaltered pose of the device. If you provide /pose/tip in your rendermodel you should set it to the position and rotation that are appropriate for pointing (i.e. with a laser pointer) with your controller.

# Default Bindings

Driver writers may provide a default set of bindings for applications. This is commonly done for applications that were released prior to the controller descripted in the input profile.

The collection of bindings should be provided as an array. Each binding is a pairing of a Steam application key and the associated binding file's name.

**app_key** names the app that the binding will apply to.

**binding_url** is the name of the file that contains the binding. These files are assumed to be in the same directory as the input profile, although a relative path can be used.

There may be multiple sources that provide possible bindings. The system will pick a binding for an application in the following order (where lower numbered items are selected first):
1. A binding set by the user.
2. A binding shipped with an application by an application developer.
3. A binding set on the partner.steamworks site.
4. A default binding set by the driver writer. This is what is described in this article.
